# MobileAppProject
A Windows application Project for college
I've made the first commit to the project so at least it's started
Second commit is me starting again, first commit was a test template
Added the main page.. now has the textboxes for entering
More work done on initial way to add a grid to the screen... no luck as of yet but progress made
grid finally adding to screen.. problem was that I needed a 'click' event handler and i was using a tapped
Over Haul of project again.. initial scope of project beyond my capabilities :)
Started connect four, coming along well- elipses added to grid properly and added into array for searching
will add saved settings.. player Names and amount of times won
added all possible moves using huge if else statement... not very efficent but it work.... may replace with function depending on time constraints
must work on logic to seach for connection of pieces
added more logic to search
need to find out how to access object by name within an if statement
get sub string of named elipse for row, column
use these values to add ellipse properly
then use these values to check correctly
used nested for loops to search through array and have managed to find all wins 
added instructions
added a working win counter by making player info global information
added error handling so pieces must go one after the other
add more error handling so that you must reset after a win
project completed.. may try to add saved settings
